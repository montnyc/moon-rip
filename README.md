> Download online videos and convert them to audio with AI-powered cover art selection

A simple, interactive CLI tool that downloads online videos, extracts high-quality audio, and uses AI to automatically pick the best frame for album cover art.

## What it does

1. You paste a video URL
2. Pick your audio format (MP3, M4A, or WAV)
3. Optionally describe what kind of cover art you want ("happy concert scene", "vibrant colors", etc.)
4. moonrip downloads, converts, extracts frames, and uses AI to pick the perfect cover art
5. You get a beautiful audio file with embedded album art

## Prerequisites

  ```bash
  brew install yt-dlp  # macOS
  # or: sudo apt install yt-dlp  # Linux
  ```
- **[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org)** - Media converter

## Usage

**Option 1: With local Moondream server (recommended)**

```

Then run moonrip in another terminal:
```bash
bun start
```

**Option 2: With cloud API**

Just run:
```bash
bun start
```

Set your API key for better results:
```bash
export MOONDREAM_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Get free key at https://console.moondream.ai

Then follow the interactive prompts!

## Motivation

I download a lot of live sets and DJ mixes. I wanted a simple way to grab the audio with nice cover art automatically selected from the video, so I built this.

## Goals

- **Simple UX** - Just paste a URL and answer a few questions
- **Visual selection** - Automatically picks the best frame for cover art, or matches your description
- **High Quality** - Best available audio quality, properly tagged with metadata
- **Type-Safe** - Built with Effect for robust error handling
- **Fast** - Uses Bun for maximum performance

## Tech Stack
